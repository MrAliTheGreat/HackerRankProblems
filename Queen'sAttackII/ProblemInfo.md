You will be given a square chess board with one queen and a number of obstacles placed on it. Determine how many squares the queen can attack.

A queen is standing on an n*n chessboard. The chess board's rows are numbered from 1 to n, going from bottom to top. Its columns are numbered from 1 to n, going from left to right. Each square is referenced by a tuple, (r,c), describing the row, r, and column, c, where the square is located.

The queen is standing at position (rq , cq). In a single move, she can attack any square in any of the eight directions (left, right, up, down, and the four diagonals).

The first line contains two space-separated integers n and k, the length of the board's sides and the number of obstacles.
The next line contains two space-separated integers rq and cq, the queen's row and column position.
Each of the next k lines contains two space-separated integers r[i] and c[i], the row and column position of obstacle[i]
