After setup connecting to 1.1.1.1 is possible by the command below in terminal:

sudo wg-quick up wg0


Disconnecting is also possible by this command in terminal:

sudo wg-quick down wg0


To make sure that you are connected to 1.1.1.1 you can use the link below:

1.1.1.1/help


It sometimes take multiple connections and disconnections to finally get it up and running don't worry it'll connect eventually!

 

2. Windscribe

For ubuntu setup you can use instructions in windscribe.com
of course the commands need connection to windscribe.com which is blocked so using part 1 above you can first connect to 1.1.1.1 which is not blocked then setup windscribe


After setup you can login to windscribe using your username and password by the command below:

windscribe login 


For vpn connection you can simply use this command:

windscribe connect
