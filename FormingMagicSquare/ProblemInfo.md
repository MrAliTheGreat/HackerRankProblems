You will be given a 3*3 matrix s of integers in the inclusive range [1:9]. We can convert any digit a to any other digit b in the range [1:9] at cost of |a-b|. Given , convert it into a magic square at minimal cost. Print this cost on a new line.

Note: The resulting magic square must contain distinct integers in the inclusive range [1:9].



Sample input:
